            <iframe src="https://chris-sarli.github.io/GBFS-Viewer/" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            <div class="link_box">Full tool is available at <a href="https://chris-sarli.github.io/GBFS-Viewer/"

            <p><a href="http://chris-sarli.github.io/GBFS-Viewer/">GBFS Viewer</a> is a very simple tool that uses <a href="https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs"
                    target="_blank">GBFS</a> feeds to provide a realtime map of multiple scooter- and bike-share
                systems.
                The tool is adaptable to any City and feed provider (as long as their
                GBFS follows the <a href="https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/gbfs.md" target="_blank">official
                    specification</a>), but this instance has been created for
                operators in Providence, RI.</p>
            <p>The tool also counts vehicles per geographic zone specified for <a
                    href="https://www.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PTD-Regulations-Sept-1-2019.pdf"
                    target="_blank">regulatory distribution requirements.</a></p>
            <p>This project was inspired by a conversation with a member of the City&#146;s planning department about
                the
                analytic challenges and opportunities associated with micromobility. A purpose of a GBFS feed is to make
                micromobility data available to the general public. The structure of GBFS is technical in nature:
                it&rsquo;s
                all JSON. While this is very helpful for developers, it&rsquo;s useless to the majority of the public.
            </p>
            <p>I knew that most people who <em>would</em> want or need to do advanced geospatial analysis of this data
                either worked for the City and had access to non-public <a
                    href="https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification" target="_blank">MDS</a>
                APIs or, like me, could deal with JSON. While there are many ways this data could be made useful to
                <em>and</em> usable by the public, a map was the most intuitive. While geographic illiteracy sadly
                remains an issue in Providence, any type of location-based information can most easily be understood in
                this form. Therefore, I saw the provision of this information to the public (without requiring the
                installation of any of the company&rsquo;s software) as a reasonable and useful public service.</p>
            <p>On the recommendation of my interlocutor, I dove into <a href="https://leafletjs.com"
                    target="_blank">Leaflet</a> for this assignment. For the most part, the interface is one big
                Leaflet map, extended with some custom buttons to refresh data from the GBFS feeds. The
                zone counting mentioned above was added after the basic functionality was implemented. <a
                    href="https://qgis.org/en/site/" target="_blank">QGIS</a> was used to
                create zone shapes from <a href="http://www.rigis.org" target="_blank">RIGIS</a> data, and <a
                    href="https://turfjs.org" target="_blank">Turf.js</a> is used to count the number of vehicles in each zone.</p>
            <p>GBFS Viewer is under active (if gradual) development. I intend to create a slightly more advanced
                version, which can display <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Isochrone"
                    target="_blank">isochrones</a> for all vehicles simultaneously.</p>
